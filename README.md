# BitcoinTicker
This app lets you find the current Bitcoin value in whichever currency you pick
This uses JSON and an API that I coded up here.

## How to Install
Download or clone this repository to your MacOS-compatible machine, open the latest version of XCode, and double-click on the file ending in xcodeproj. Click the play button at the top of the left screen and have it run on your Xcode simulator. Alternatively, you may plug in your iPhone to your Mac via USB-C or Lighting, then follow this tutorial by clicking [here](https://buildfire.com/how-to-test-your-app-on-an-iphone-using-xcode/.
